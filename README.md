## Feature
- `20251104` Export and import the configuration using a file.
- Update the "What's New" section in App Store Connect on a single page.

## Why not open-sourced?

Because some API keys (GitHub / OpenAI) are hard-coded in the app, this project is soft-closed-source. If you’re interested in the source code, [email me](mailto:rijie.li@outlook.com) and I’ll grant access to your GitHub account.
